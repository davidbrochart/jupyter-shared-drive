Jupyter Shared Drive consists of an optional Jupyter Server extension and a JupyterLab extension providing support for [Y documents](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_ydoc) and adding a new drive for sharing these documents through WebRTC.

The server extension provides the signaling service needed for peers to discover each other. It will typically be installed and used with a full JupyterLab setup, but it is not mandatory. For instance, a public signaling server can be used instead, and the JupyterLab frontend extension can be configured to use it. This means that Jupyter Shared Drive can be used without a Jupyter server, and that it works in JupyterLite ðŸš€

## Installation and Basic usage

To install the latest release locally, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

```bash
pip install jupyter-shared-drive
```

Or using ``conda``/``mamba``/``micromamba`` (soon!):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-shared-drive
```

In JupyterLab, a new drive is made available with prefix `Shared:`, and accessible through a `Shared Drive` file browser at the bottom of the left toolbar. It is separate from the default drive (accessible through the file browser at the top), but files can be imported/exported from/to it. Files in the shared drive are stored in each client's browser, and synchronized with connected clients.
