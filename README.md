Jupyter Shared Drive consists of an optional Jupyter Server extension and a JupyterLab extension providing support for [Y documents](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_ydoc) and adding a new drive for sharing these documents through WebRTC.

The server extension provides the signaling service needed for peers to discover each other. It will typically be installed and used with a full JupyterLab setup, but it is not mandatory. For instance, a public signaling server can be used instead, and the JupyterLab frontend extension can be configured to use it. This means that Jupyter Shared Drive can be used without a Jupyter server, and that it works in JupyterLite ðŸš€
